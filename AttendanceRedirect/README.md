# Attendance Redirect

We use this script in conjunction with the mobile app to help users report their attendance with the Report Family Attendance registration type.  
This helps get the user to the right Involvement's registration. 

To use, create an authenticated link in the app.  Point to this script.  You'll need to modify the script to isolate the meetings you specifically 
want to see.  We use this for worship services that have communion and identify those with an Extra Value on the *Meeting* with the name "communion"
(the value doesn't matter)
