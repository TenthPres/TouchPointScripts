# Children's Involvement Rules

This simple script automatically makes sure that any Involvements of the type "Children's Program" have the `ministrysafeonlabel`
and `backgroundcheckonlabel` Extra Values checked so those icons appear on stickers. 

To do this, you'll need an involvement type for Children's Programs (what you call it doesn't matter), and it'll need to have the
Code "CHILD".  (Or, you can change the code in the script to whatever you want.) 

We run this as part of our daily batch so we always have those settings present on Children's involvements.
