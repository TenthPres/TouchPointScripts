# Classroom Redirect

We find the process for getting a volunteer into their classroom dashboard to be rather unintuitive.  So, we created this script and have it linked from an
easily-accessible place in the app.  

This script:
- Automatically redirects a volunteer to their current classroom dashboard (or the meeting if not using check-in) if they're a leader/volunteer in one meeting happening now
- Lists meetings for a volunteer to choose if they're a leader/volunteer in multiple meetings happening now (e.g. a supervisor over several rooms)
- Says there's nothing to see if there isn't a current meeting.
