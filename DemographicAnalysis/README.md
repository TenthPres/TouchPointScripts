# Demographic Analysis

This is a report you should add to your blue toolbar to run some demographics on whatever involvement/tag/search you're looking at.  

It will produce an age distribution, church membership statuses, Parish (Resident Code) distribution, and an attempt at Family Type (single, couple, with children, etc)
