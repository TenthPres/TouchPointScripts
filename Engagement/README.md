# Engagement

This report is a Blue Toolbar report used to look at the latest enagement of people who may be falling through the cracks.  For everyone in the Blue Toolbar
context, it will show their Assigned Shepherd (see the seprarate Assigned Shepherd scripts for more on that), and also list the most recent of this person's
recorded interactions, including attendance, additions to an involvement (performed by them or someone else), and email opens. 

This script will likely need some customization for your context.  If you need help with that, do get in touch.
