# Family Attendance

This is a Blue Toolbar report that generates a printable list for taking attendance.  While there are lots of methods for printing lists for attendance, this one is fairly simple, and
is specifically intended for events with lots of families, so the family members can be readily identified together. 

We use this for a particular outreach event where we specifically want the informal appearance of paper sign-ins.
