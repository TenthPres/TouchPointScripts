# Incoming Email

This script is used in conjunction with a Power Automate flow to handle emails that are sent to a particular address.  We use this to collect prayer requests.  See the Prayer Requests
scripts for more information there. 

If you want to implement this, you'll need a paid Power Automate plan, or a reasonable alternative.  You'll also need a username and password with API permissions. [You can see the Power Automate flow we use here.](../.documentation/IncomingEmailFlowExample.png?raw=true)
