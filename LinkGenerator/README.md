# Link Generator

Sometimes, you (an admin on your database) just need to be able to send someone a link that will automatically sign them into TouchPoint to help them get where they're going.
This simple script gives you a form where you (admin) can put in your intended destination URL and a PeopleId who should be signed into it.  It will then generate an
authenticated link that you can share by one-on-one text or email. 

We have particularly used this to help users who have trouble accessing the volunteer scheduler.
