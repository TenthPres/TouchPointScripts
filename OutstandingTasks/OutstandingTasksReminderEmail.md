{first},

You have been assigned or delegated at least one task in MyTenth which needs follow-up in the form of contacting someone. Only one person is assigned a task at a time, so if you haven't completed it, no one has. Once completed, please mark the task as complete in the system. Or, if the task would be handled better by someone else, please re-delegate the task.

To mark a task as Complete, open your task list by clicking on a task below. Each Task will have a blue button towards the right side, to either "Accept" the task (agree to take it on), or "Complete" the task. Please Accept and Complete all of your current Tasks.
